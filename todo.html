Some checks to perform before committing the code:

1. Check all components have their type definition as a separate type.
2. Always make sure that all the compnents that are using hooks have 'use client'.
3. Check if type is assigned to all the `useState()`.
4. Check if all the `import` URLs start with '@/....'.
5. All the component's names which doesn't denote the page name should start with a capital letter.
5.1. Name of the types for the functions declared inside or outside the component should start with a capital letter. Like for `getData`, the type should be `GetData`.
6. Types for all the components should be defined in a separate type file of the component.
7. Types defined for a component's props should be in the same file. Like for `Header` component, the type should be `HeaderProps`.
8. Types declared for the functions inside a component should be in the different file called types.ts inside the component's folder.
9. The difference between the name of the function and its type is of that type's name will start with a capital letter and the function's name will start with a small letter. For example, if the function is `getData`, then the type should be `GetData`.
10: Is JSDoc comments added for all the functions and types?
